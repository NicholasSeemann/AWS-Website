Hello!

This is just a quick project I wanted to do to learn the basics of using AWS, so I will not be focusing too strongly on making a website that is very pretty or interactive, it's primarily about getting a website up and running using AWS and Node.js

It took quite a bit of troubleshooting, but it seems to finally be stable with no 502 errors, at least as of August 27th, 2024, haha!
